									<h3>Research</h3>
									<p>How does thermosensation evolve? As thermal environments shift, how do sensory systems adapt? 
									I study this question by investigating TRP channels, a family of ion channels than can function as molecular thermosensors by turning temperature stimuli into electrical signals. 
									I combine transcriptomics, genomics, bioinformatics, electrophysiology, fieldwork, and behavior studies to answer these questions across integrated levels of organization in both vertebrates and invertebrates.</p>

												<h4>Arctic codfishes</h4>
												<p>Some areas of the Arctic Ocean are warming up to seven fold the rate of the global average. 
												Warming endangers key subsistence and commericial fisheries and fish populations. 
												I am studying the evolution of TRP channel sequences, expression, and structures in different thermosensory tissues across Arctic codfishes that vary in their preferred thermal environments. 
												This study is funded by the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs postdoctoral research fellowship.

												<h4>Notothenioid fishes</h4>
												<p>Notothenioids are a suborder of fishes that make up the primary fish fauna of the Southern Ocean. 
												The Southern Ocean surrounds Antarctica and generally stays between -1.9 and +1 degree Celsius all year, and has been this cold for several million years. 
												I am investigating how TRP channels have evolved to sense ecologically relevant temperatures for the Southern Ocean and comparing evolution of these channels in species that have secondarily adapted to temperate environments.
												This study is funded by the Fulbright Commission and will be conducted at the Universidad Austral de Chile and in the Chilean Antarctic.

												<h4>Texas leaf-cutter ants</h4>
												<p>The Texas leaf-cutter ant (<em>Atta texana</em>) is the most northerly distributed leaf-cutter ant, but the distribution isn't limited by the ants' own temperature tolerance.
												 Instead, it is limited by the cold sensitivity of the fungus the ants cultivate in gardens within their colonies. These ants have been shown to be 
												 behaviorally sensitive to the narrow range in temperatures at which the fungus grows optimally, but what is the molecular basis of this temperature sensitivity, 
												 and how has that changed as the Texas leaf-cutters have expanded their range northward?

										<h3>Engagement</h3>
									</header>
									<p>As a scientist, I sometimes feel conflicted about the role of researchers in publicizing their science and engaging with the public. 
									Doing the science is a full time job, and the skills that make someone a good scientist do not entirely overlap with the skills involved in being a good communicator. 
									I recognize, however, that with the current scientific system there is value for both the public and the scientist when communication between these groups increases. 
									Below is a summary of some of my efforts to increase that communication.</p>

													<h4>Science Under the Stars</h4>
													<p>At UT Austin I helped organize a series of monthly science talks called <a href="https://scienceunderthestars.org/" target="_blank">Science Under the Stars</a> between 2017 and 2022. Events are free, open to the public, and held outdoors at <a href="https://bfl.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Brackenridge Field Laboratory</a>. 
													The speakers are biology graduate students who <a href="https://scienceunderthestars.org/previous-talks/" target="_blank">share work ranging</a> from bat behavior to tropical tree evolution to flu epidemiology and sustainable gardening. 
													Events also include kids activities, snacks, natural history displays, and tours of the field lab.
